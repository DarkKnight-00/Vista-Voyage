Problem Statement/Objective
Creating a C++ application for tourism management, including train and flight reservations as well as hotel reservations.You can efficiently plan your trip by searching for and reserving accommodations and reserving transportation to your destination. The system manages conflicts to prevent double bookings and provides seamless options for changing or canceling reservations.
Features Of C++ used
Classes: The database connection functionalities are encapsulated in the response class.
File Inclusion: The code makes use of a number of C++ header files, including and, for functions related to the console, file handling, input/output, and string manipulation.
Namespace: The code makes it obvious that standard C++ library functions are being used by using the std namespace throughout.
Structures: Structures are used in the code to manage and arrange related data objects under a single name. It offers a method for more logically and orderly representation of complicated data structures.
Switch-Case: The main function uses a switch-case statement to carry out various actions according to the menu selection made by the user.
Exception Handling: Basic exception handling is included in the code for error checking and input validation.
Use of Arrays: Trip itinerary data and user information are stored in arrays.
File I/O: Since the code handles user and trip information, file input/output operations may be involved, even though they aren't stated explicitly.
Control Statements: The code uses control statements to regulate flow, including while, switch, and if, else if, else.
Function Calls: To accomplish particular tasks, the main function makes calls to other functions, encouraging modular code organization.
Features of Projects:
File Handling:File handling in a tourism management system involves using
C++ to store and retrieve data in files. This allows for data persistence, import/export functionality, error handling, and data integrity checks, ensuring efficient management and storage of information between sessions.
Menu-Driven Interface:Presents a menu-driven interface allowing users to choose from various options.
Show Users:Retrieves and displays details of all users (travelers) from the database.
Find User:Searches for room number and displays their details.
Edit User:Modifies user details, including name, address, phone, email, trip date, trip plan, and cost.
Delete User:Deletes a user record from the database based on the selected user ID.
User Interface: Create an interface that is easy to use for administrators and visitors alike. To make sure that users can navigate the system with ease and complete tasks quickly, take usability principles into consideration.
Payment Processing: Integrating a secure payment gateway to facilitate online payments for. Payment processing is reliable, secure, and supports multiple payment methods.
